# ReactJS Webapp - _Hattrick_
The webapp is based on [React + Redux - User Registration and Login Tutorial & Example](https://github.com/cornflourblue/react-redux-registration-login-example), adding to it the use of **_React-Router_**.

Given that as base code, a webapp has been built to allow users to register, login, reset their passwords, create communities, join communities, etc.. all of that making use of the [**Loopback REST API** developed for this.](https://github.com/daniegarcia254/Loopback-API-Hattrick/tree/release/react-client)
